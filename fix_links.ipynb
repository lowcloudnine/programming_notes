      "This started with the intention to be a collection point for some useful but not necessarily working, snippets of code.  It has morphed into more of a place for links, notes, advise and procedures I use or have found useful.  This \"code depot\" started as a SharePoint Wiki at a place of employment as a way get peers to share information and knowledge and more importantly for me to document my knowledge, information and lessons learned.  While it didn't work as well as I hoped it has found other uses and was more successful then I was told it would be.  \n",
