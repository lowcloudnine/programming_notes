## [Tools](tools:start)

* ['tools:Vi/Vim'] -- A screen oriented text-editor, one of my favorite tools
* ['tools:Git'] -- My goto SCM tool.
* ['tools:PyCharm'] -- <del>Community Edition is rapidly becoming my IDE of choice</del>I bought the Professional Version and this is now my IDE of choice.
* ['tools:Eclipse'] -- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* ['tools:Windows Pseudo Backup'] -- A Python Script combined with Task Scheduler to backup your critical files
* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) -- A Windows Text Editor with support for color syntax and large files, not huge files.  I've had it support up to 1GB files but anything beyond it didn't work well and I resorted to gVim.  Great replacement for notepad.
* [hilite.me](http://hilite.me/) -- A web site that will color highlight your source code for publication.  It is how I color code various code for other sites for publication.  Simple and easy to use it works for all of the languages used in the organization this wiki was originally developed while I worked for.  I've found for dokuwiki, the engine for this wiki, it is unnecessary.
