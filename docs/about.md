This started with the intention to be a collection point for some useful but not 
necessarily working, snippets of code.  It has morphed into more of a place for 
links, notes, advise and procedures I use or have found useful.  This "code depot" 
started as a SharePoint Wiki at a place of employment as a way get peers to share 
information and knowledge and more importantly for me to document my knowledge, 
information and lessons learned.  While it didn't work as well as I hoped it 
has found other uses and was more successful then I was told it would be.  

Below are links to the wiki pages for each of the languages I'm familiar with 
if only in passing.  In the past I've worked with Java, C and C++.  Currently, 
I'm working with Python and it is by far the language I've had the most 
fun with.
