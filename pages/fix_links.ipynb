      "[Python](http://www.python.org) is a general purpose interpreted languages useful in many different scenarios. It supports procedural, object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. Libraries already exist to ease interaction with XML, netCDF and web protocols as examples. Python also has an included library to interact with the OS and is a good language for scripting on both MS Windows and Unix-like operating systems.\n",
